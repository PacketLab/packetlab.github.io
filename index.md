# Welcome to PacketLab!

### PacketLab is a new Internet measurement framework designed to facilitate vantage point sharing among the Internet measurement community.

- To try out our software package, including a reference PacketLab endpoint, experiment running utilities, and some example measurement applets, see [Downloads](/download/) *(Latest release: v1.1.0 on 2025/03/09)* and [Tutorials](/tutorial/).

<!--
> Cooperating with [EdgeNet](https://www.edge-net.org/), users can now run example measurement applets on external PacketLab endpoints. See [Tutorials](/tutorial/) for more information.
-->

- For documentation of the `libpktlab` utility library, see [Docs](/docs/).
