# Welcome to PacketLab!

### PacketLab is a new measurement endpoint interface designed to facilitate endpoint sharing among the network measurement research community.

- To try out our software package, including a reference PacketLab endpoint, experiment running utilities, and some example measurement applets, see [Downloads](/download/) *(Latest release: v0.4.1 on 2022/10/24)* and [Tutorials](/tutorial/).

> For users who would like to get a quick taste of PacketLab without performing the full setup, see the [IMC demo information page](/imc_demo/#for-other-interested-attendees) for more info on the **try-it-out special bundle**. External endpoint access included!

> Cooperating with [EdgeNet](https://www.edge-net.org/), users can now run example measurement applets on external PacketLab endpoints. See [Tutorials](/tutorial/) for more information.

- For documentation of the `libpktlab` utility library, see [Docs](/docs/).
- To learn more about PacketLab, see [About](/about/).
